### 1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
Around 8 hours for a working, responsive CRUD solution and frontend UI and with some help from AI like ChatGPT / Claude.

### 2. What would you add with more time?
- Image optimization + lazy loading
- Server-side validation and CSRF protection
- Unit tests and integration tests
- Use a router and MVC structure (or a micro-framework)
- Accessibility and keyboard navigation improvements

### 3. How would you track down a performance issue in production?
- Check slow query log, enable profiling for expensive queries
- Use Xdebug/profiler on staging for hotspots
- Analyze frontend
- Apply caching (OPcache, memcached/Redis) and optimize DB indexes
